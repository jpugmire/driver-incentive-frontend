This will be a (hopefully) simple guide on our workflow with source control. Any time you're working with our Azure repo, and submitting code for the frontend, you should use this method.

To begin, we'll go with the initial setup.
You'll need to install git on your computer.
https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

This version of git has a GUI, but it also has a CLI which I prefer to use.
The best and easiest GUI to start with in my opinion is GitKraken, which I'll link:
https://www.gitkraken.com/
and here is a cheat sheet for using GK

After installing GitKraken, or reading about how to use git in the command line (i recommend installing PoshGit for powershell if you're gonna do this, it makes it a little easier to understand what's going on)
you'll need to clone our Azure repository, the url is below:
https://S21-VanScoysBoys11-Black-McLendon-OReilly-Griffith@dev.azure.com/S21-VanScoysBoys11-Black-McLendon-OReilly-Griffith/S21-VanScoysBoys11-Black.McLendon.OReilly.Griffith.Pugmire/_git/Master

Now that you've cloned the repo to your computer, we can talk about the workflow of submitting code for tasks.

1. Create a new branch in Azure, titling it something that describes what you're doing. For extra clarity,
we should use a naming convention, like <TASK#><Author Initials><short-description>
you can't have spaces in a branch name, so for example it may look like this: 511-JBP-add-x-component

2. Come into your CLI or GitKraken in your repository, and fetch from origin using
git fetch origin
this will pull down any new branches or commits that have been created since the last time.
since you've already created a remote branch (thats one you created in azure) you should see it under remote origin on the left pane.

3. Checkout your new remote branch by double clicking or typing git checkout <branch name> in the command line. This will create a local version of the branch on your computer, where you'll make your changes. A branch is an exact copy of the existing code before you change it.

4. Once you've made your code changes, you can come into GitKraken and use the pane on the right to stage and commit your changes to the branch, or in the command line use the following commands:
git add . (adds all files that are currently untracked)
git commit -m "(here you'll type your commit message)"

5. With your changes commmitted, we now need to push them to our remote branch in Azure. To do that in GitKraken, you just need to hit the push button up top. In the CLI, you'll type git push

6. With your changes in Azure, you can open a pull request for the other team members to review and merge into the master branch
